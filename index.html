          <h3>WHAT IS BLOOD DONATION ?</h3>
          <p>
            Blood donation is the process of voluntarily giving blood, which is
            essential for saving lives. The donated blood is used for surgeries,
            emergencies, cancer treatments, and patients with chronic illnesses
            like anemia. A single donation can save up to three lives as blood
            is separated into components like red blood cells, plasma, and
            platelets.

          <h3>WHO CAN DONATE BLOOD ?</h3>
          <p>
            Most healthy adults between the ages of 17 and 65 can donate blood.
            Donors must weigh at least 50 kg (110 pounds) and meet basic health
            requirements. Before donating, individuals undergo a health
            screening to ensure that the donation is safe for both the donor and
            recipient. Donors can give blood every 56 days for whole blood
            donations.

          <h3>WHY IS BLOOD DONATION IMPORTANT ?</h3>
          <p>
            Blood donation is crucial because there is no substitute for human
            blood. It's constantly needed for medical procedures and
            emergencies. By donating, you help ensure a stable blood supply,
            which can save lives, especially in times of crisis. Regular donors
            play a vital role in keeping communities healthy and prepared for
            unforeseen events

        <div class="faq-answer">
          Yes, donating blood is generally safe. Blood donation centres follow
          strict safety protocols to ensure that the process is safe for both
          donors and recipients. Sterile, single-use equipment is used for each

        <div class="faq-answer">
          After donation, blood is tested for infectious diseases, blood type,

          cells, plasma, and platelets and stored appropriately until needed by
          patients.

        <div class="faq-answer">
          In many places, you can donate blood if you have a tattoo or piercing,
          provided it was done with sterile needles and ink at a licensed
          facility. You may need to wait a certain period, typically around 3-12
          months, depending on local regulations.

        </div>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          Donors may feel a quick pinch or sting when the needle is inserted,
          but many people find it relatively painless. Some may experience
          slight discomfort or bruising afterward, but this usually resolves
          quickly.

        <div class="faq-answer">
          Many medications do not disqualify you from donating blood, but it
          depends on the type of medication and the reason you are taking it.
          It's best to inform the donation center about any medications you're
          taking, so they can assess your eligibility.

          Donating blood helps save lives by providing vital blood components to
          patients in need. It can also have health benefits for the donor, such
